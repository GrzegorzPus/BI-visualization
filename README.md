# BI-visualization
In this folder, you will find a collection of my fascinating projects created using the Power BI program. Each project is the result of my work where I utilized skills in data collection, analysis, and visualization to uncover valuable insights and trends. Each file contains interactive reports and dynamic charts that allow for delving into the data and exploring meaningful information. I invite you to explore these projects, which reflect my commitment to the world of data analysis and the pursuit of a better understanding of the surrounding reality.
